# GoToHP for iOS (Gunshot)

[English](README.md) · [日本語](README.ja.md)

**Gunshot (GoToHP for iOS)** is a tweak / injected library for the official iOS Google Photos app that spoofs your device as a Google Pixel, enabling original-quality unlimited cloud backups and custom upload behaviors. It integrates an optimized iOS port of the Go core from [xob0t/gotohp](https://github.com/xob0t/gotohp).

It supports both **Jailbroken** environments (Rootless and Rootful) and **Jailed** environments (Sideloading, TrollStore, and LiveContainer).

## 🌟 Key Features

- **Pixel Spoofing Uploads**:
  - **Original Quality (Unlimited)**: Spoofs a Pixel XL (Pixel 1) to upload photos and videos in full original quality without consuming Google Account storage quota.
  - **Storage Saver**: Spoofs a Pixel 2 for unlimited uploads in Storage Saver quality.
  - **Account Storage**: Spoofs a Pixel 8 for original quality using standard account quota.
- **Native Backup Routing**:
  - Automatically intercepts Google Photos' standard manual and automatic backup triggers and routes them through the GoToHP queue.
  - Seamlessly back up your library simply by using the Google Photos app normally.
- **Zero-Config Account Sync**:
  - Automatically detects the signed-in Google account and acquires OAuth tokens via Google Photos' existing SSO framework.
  - No need to extract, copy, or paste tokens manually.
- **Bulk Album Import**:
  - Bypasses the iOS system picker limitation (100 items per selection) by importing entire albums directly with batch processing.
- **Full Fidelity & Live Photo Support**:
  - Extracts untouched original media directly via PhotoKit without re-encoding.
  - Preserves HEIC, RAW, and pairs both still and video components of **Live Photos**.
- **Native UI Integration**:
  - Integrates the "GoToHP Settings" menu directly into the Google Photos profile sheet.
  - Optional banner to display the authentic Google Pixel "Unlimited storage" badge.
- **Bilingual Support**: Fully localized in English and Japanese.

## 🚀 Installation

### 1. Sideloading / TrollStore / LiveContainer (Non-Jailbroken)
See the full [Jailed Installation Guide](docs/jailed.md) for detailed walkthroughs.

- **Using Sideloadly**:
  1. Open your decrypted Google Photos IPA in Sideloadly.
  2. Under **Advanced Options → Inject dylibs/frameworks**, add `gotohp-tweak-jailed.deb`.
  3. Start the installation to your device.
- **Using TrollStore or Manual Injection**:
  - Inject `gotohp-tweak-jailed.deb` into your decrypted IPA (using tools like Azule or Sideloadly Export) and install via TrollStore.
- **Using LiveContainer**:
  - Import `GunshotJailed.dylib` into the LiveContainer tweaks folder for Google Photos.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Inject and enable Gunshot BEFORE signing into your Google account.**  
> GunshotJailed includes automatic SSO identifier and Keychain corrections to fix sideload login issues (no separate Sideload Spoofer required).

### 2. Jailbreak
1. Install `gotohp-tweak-rootless.deb` or `gotohp-tweak-rootful.deb` through your package manager (Sileo, Zebra, etc.).
2. Requires **libSandy 1.1.6+** from [opa334's repository](https://opa334.github.io/) as a dependency.
3. If Google Photos crashes upon launch, configure **Choicy** to inject only Gunshot into Google Photos.

## 📖 How to Use

1. **Launch Google Photos and Sign In**
   - GoToHP will automatically connect to your active Google account in the background. No manual token setup needed.
2. **Review Upload Settings**
   - Tap your **Profile icon → GoToHP Settings**.
   - Choose your desired upload quality (Original / Storage Saver / Account Storage).
3. **Upload Photos & Videos**
   - **Automatic Native Backup**:
     - Turn on **Route manual and automatic backups through GoToHP** in settings (ensure Google Photos' built-in backup is also enabled).
     - Photos will now automatically be routed through GoToHP's Pixel-spoofed queue. See [Native Backup Routing](docs/native-routing.md).
   - **Manual Upload**:
     - Tap **Uploads → Choose photos and videos** (up to 100 items per selection).
     - Or choose **Choose album** to queue entire albums at once (see [Bulk Import Guide](docs/bulk-import.md)).

> [!NOTE]
> - **Sideloaded (Jailed) builds**: Uploading occurs while Google Photos is active in the foreground. Keep the app open while uploading.
> - **Jailbroken builds**: Once media is staged into the queue, the background daemon handles the upload even if you close Google Photos.
